# Force Command Classification Script

This Python script processes force command data from a CSV file, classifying movements and generating new labels for the data based on specific thresholds for the x, y, and z force commands. It also includes feature engineering to create binary labels and combined force analysis.

## Features

- **Input**: A CSV file containing force command data for the x, y, and z axes.
- **Output**: A new CSV file that includes additional labeled columns:
  - `x force label`: Classification of x-axis force commands.
  - `y force label`: Classification of y-axis force commands.
  - `z force label`: Classification of z-axis force commands.
  - `swiping in motion`: Indicates whether swiping is happening based on force commands in all three axes.
  - `swiping_binary`: A binary label (1 for swiping, 0 for no swiping).
  - `combined force label`: A custom label based on combinations of force thresholds (e.g., high x, low z).

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and the following libraries:

- Pandas

You can install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

1. **Input CSV File**: Place your CSV file with force command data in a known location.
2. **Configure Paths**: Update the `input_file` and `output_file` variables in the script to point to your input file and desired output location.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to generate the classified output CSV file with the newly labeled data.

### Example Command:

```bash
python classify_force_commands.py
```

## Output

The output CSV will contain the following columns:
- `x force command`, `y force command`, `z force command`: Original force commands from the input file.
- `x force label`, `y force label`, `z force label`: Labels classifying the force commands.
- `swiping in motion`: Label indicating if swiping occurred based on all three axes.
- `swiping_binary`: A binary indicator for swiping (1 for swiping, 0 for no swiping).
- `combined force label`: A custom label based on combinations of force thresholds.

## Performance

The script will print the time taken to classify and save the data after processing.

This file should guide users on how to execute the script and understand its functionality.
