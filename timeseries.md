# Force Command Time Series Visualization with Swipe Annotations

This script visualizes time series data for x, y, and z force commands from a CSV file, with annotated regions indicating whether swiping is in motion. The output is a plot with color-coded force commands and swiping/no-swiping regions.

## Features

- **Visualize Force Commands**: Plots the x, y, and z force commands over time.
- **Swipe Annotation**: Highlights regions where swiping is detected in yellow, and no-swiping regions in gray.
- **Custom Legend**: Includes a legend showing the force commands and swiping annotations for clear interpretation.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas (for data handling)
- Matplotlib (for plotting)

To install the required libraries, use:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Input CSV File**: Make sure the CSV file containing force commands and swiping annotations is available.
2. **Configure File Path**: Update the `csv_file_path` variable in the script to point to the location of your CSV file.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to visualize the data.

### Example Command:

```bash
python visualize_force_commands.py
```

## Input Data

The input CSV file should contain the following columns:
- `x force command`: Force command data for the x-axis.
- `y force command`: Force command data for the y-axis.
- `z force command`: Force command data for the z-axis.
- `swiping in motion`: Annotation of whether swiping is occurring (`swiping` or `no swiping`).

## Output

The script generates a time series plot that includes:
- A line plot for the x, y, and z force commands.
- Highlighted regions showing where swiping is in motion (yellow) and where it is not (gray).

## Customization

You can adjust the following in the script:
- **Colors**: Change the colors for force commands or swiping regions in the `plt.plot()` and `plt.axvspan()` functions.
- **Labels and Title**: Modify axis labels and the plot title in the `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()`, and `plt.title()` functions.

## Example Plot

The plot will show how force commands change over time, with swiping events clearly marked for easier analysis.

This README should help users understand how to use the script and interpret the plot it generates.
